C is focussed on portablility. There are 5 main topics we need to
watch for regrading this:

1) Implementation-Defined Behavior
This is defined as program behavior thats not specified by the C Standard 
and might offer different results among implementations but has consistent,
documented behavior within its implementation. For example bits in a byte.

Coming from the firmware/micro controller world, this could be 8 bits per byte 
while an os is 32 or 64 bits per byte. Arduinos use 8 bit values while Cortex M7
processors like the one found on the Teensy 4.1 use 32 bit bytes. This makes a load
of difference when determining how to store different data types and other general 
operations that seem trivial but the results might differ.

We should try to avoid writing code that is subject to this, but it is mostly 
a non-issue and there are clever ways to handle these cases in the preprocessor.

2) Unspecified Behavior
